#  Advent of Code

##  What is it?
(_I took description from about section at [main site](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about)_)

_Advent of Code_ is an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in [any](https://github.com/search?q=advent+of+code) programming language you like.
  
## About my attempt

2023: I started a little bit late (at 20 Dec), but I will try to complete whole challenge anyway (finished on May 21st)
2024: Returning to github after doing some side projects. In this year I started exactly at 1th of December. Wish me luck!!!
