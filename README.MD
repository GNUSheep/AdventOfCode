##  What is it
(_I took description from about section at [main site](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about)_)

_Advent of Code_ is an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in [any](https://github.com/search?q=advent+of+code) programming language you like.
  
## About my attempt

Whole code is wrote in Python
