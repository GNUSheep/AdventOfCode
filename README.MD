## About my attempt

2023: I started a little bit late (at 20 Dec), but I will try to complete whole challenge anyway (finished on May 21st)
2024: Returning to github after doing some side projects. In this year I started exactly at 1th of December. Wish me luck!!!. (Finished it on time, I am very proud of myself, I learned new things, and I was having fun doing every day challange)
